# The Utopia Project
The feasible, actionable design of a socio-politico-economic utopia for the present day.

These are the working plans of a utopian society, to be built from technology available today, buildable by people of today, with the goal of creating a living environment that allows, ideally, for humans to live their lives contributing what they can and want while living a life of study and leisure.

# Civics

Civics is the study of the rights and obligations of citizens in society.  The chief obligation of any society is to govern itself.

## Rigts

There must be a constitution and bill of rights.  

A [constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution) is the aggregate of fundamental principles or established precedents that constitute the legal basis of a polity, organisation or other type of entity and commonly determine how that entity is to be governed.  A bill of rights 

A [bill of rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_rights), sometimes called a declaration of rights or a charter of rights, is a list of the most important rights to the citizens of a country. The purpose is to protect those rights against infringement from public officials and private citizens.

## Governance

The ultimate design of a system of active governance must be one that manages resilience to corruption against operational efficiency.  This design must assume that once self-interest is introduced into the system, then the system will become corrupted.  Therefore, it must see corruption not as something that can be wholly prevented, but as something inevitable.  While system protections will be necessary, the design must concede that protections that work will come at the cost of system efficiency.  

We've seen enough history to see how governments have used economics, culture, and the rule of law to ultimately supress the very people they were meant to serve.

Such a design will be well-informed by [game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory).

# Economy

The design of an economy must manage ecnomic mobility against an inherently flawed system of positive feedback loops into wealth concentration wells (i.e. greed), insofar as money being necessary for people to live the lives they want to live.

So the goal of the design of an economy must be to minimize pressure on humans to amass wealth while at the same time offering some kind of incentive to people to contribute in meaningful ways to the building, maintenance, and improvement of the structure and performance of the socio-politico-economic machine in which they live and benefit from.

Such a design must concede that a happier human is a more productive human, and that productivity can be measured in more than just money.

# Society

There must be an established set of core cultural norms.  This is where we can excise all the toxic traits of modern culture, the parts of a civilation that can't be governed and doesn't contribute directly to the economy.  It should be easier to list all the things a human should do as opposed to listing all the things a human shouldn't do.

The foundation of such a broad category of thought can be found in [Humanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanism) - a philosophical stance that emphasizes the individual and social potential, and agency of human beings, whom it considers the starting point for serious moral and philosophical inquiry.

# Technology

Technology is ubiquitous, and will remain ubiquitous.  We must leverage technology while recognizing that technology is not a panacea.  We must find a way to realize its promises and leverage them in positive, constructive ways while minimizing its negative impacts.  Two significant negative impacts are addiction, and the accelerated propagation of cultural toxicity.  The poeple must always have unfettered, unfiltered access to information, as well as the unhindered ability to broadcast information.  Technology allows this, so we must use it.
